Start scene:
- Scenes/StartMenu

How to play:
- Navigate through the platforms to collect all the relics (gems) in the game
- Move with WASD, block with Right Click, swing sword with Left Click
- Some platforms have floating lava balls, avoid or strike them with sword
- After collecting all relics in first section, press Spacebar to jump
- After collecting all relics in second section, hold Shift to sprint
- Defeat the boss at the end of the level and collect the dropped gem to beat the game

Technology requirements:
- Game feel
  - Notice how the player is in 3p and has mostly smooth animations and interactive sound effects
  - The player has interesting choices, such as how to time their movements, whether to attack the orbs or run, going left or right first during the Run Relics section
- Environment
  - Notice how the environment is scripted to move in a compelling way, such as moving and swinging obstacles
  - The environment acknowledges the player, such as how the AI orbs will animate faster when the player is close
  - The moving obstacles emit sounds, improving immersion
- AI
  - Observe the state-machine-like behavior of the orbs, how they transition between sentry and chase mode
  - Observe the behavior of the boss, how it transitions between various animation and behavior states, chasing, short range attack, long range attack, and dying
  - Orbs emit sounds when doing damage, providing feedback
  - The boss makes different sounds for different attacks, providing feedback

Known issues:
- Going up and down verticallly moving platforms will cause the player to visually vibrate
- Standing on a rotating obstacle won't cause the player to move along the rotating surface
- The floating pillars use capsule colliders, causing clipping at the edges
- Animations between "left" and "right" for the player aren't very smooth, rather instantaneous
- If killed by the fire orbs, the orbs don't stop attacking even afte the player dies
- Sword sound effect will play when in the death menu and hitting restart
- Pausing the game while the scene is fading in will result in an unclickable menu
- Jumping during a sprint does not conserve initial momentum
- Destroying an orb does not always play the orb destruction sound
